FLEX FINANCE CLONE :
In a bid to elevate my skills,I took on the challenge of cloning the landing page of FLEX FINANCE, a state of the art website whose interface I found appealing, as my first official project.This project challenged my adaptability as I had no prior knowledge of the design library (Reactstrap)used. I gained further mastery in the application of bootstrap utilities and my ability to implement design for maximal responsiveness and a seamless user experience was honed.
